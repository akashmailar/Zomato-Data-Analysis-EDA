# Zomato Data Analysis (EDA)
Welcome to the Zomato Data Analysis project! This page showcases an in-depth exploratory data analysis (EDA) of a Zomato restaurant dataset. The goal of this analysis is to uncover insights and trends from the dataset, which includes restaurant information, ratings, and more. Here, you will find interactive visualizations, detailed findings, and an explanation of the techniques used in the analysis.

## Overview of the Analysis
The Zomato dataset consists of various features like name, restaurant type, user ratings, average cost for two people, and much more. Through this analysis, we aim to understand key patterns and relationships within the data, focusing on:

- Distribution of restaurant ratings across different restaurant types and online/offline orders.
- Average cost for two people in different restaurant types and online/offline orders.
- Factors influencing restaurant ratings such as online orders and offline orders.

## Key Features
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Dive into the data to understand trends, distributions, and correlations between different variables.
- **Data Cleaning**: Handling missing values, duplicates, and ensuring data consistency.
- **Visualization**: Interactive charts and graphs that showcase insights such as the distribution of ratings, cost for two, and more.
- **Insights**: Key takeaways from the data to understand customer preferences, and restaurant performance.

## Technologies Used
This project uses the following technologies:
